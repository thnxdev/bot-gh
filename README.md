# Burden Bot for Open Source Github Repositories
The Burden Bot is a github bot that can be added to open source Github repositories to help with the management of issues and pull requests. This bot has advanced features such as identifying feature requests and the requestor's affiliation with a Fortune 500 organization. Additionally, it can identify if the requestor's organization has sponsored the repo maintainer via Thanks.dev.


## Features
The Burden Bot can perform the following functions:

Automatically identify if an issue or pull request is a feature request.
Identify if the requestor is affiliated with a Fortune 500 organization.
Identify if the requestor's organization has sponsored the repo maintainer via Thanks.dev.
Leave a message asking for sponsorship from the requestor's organization if they belong to a Fortune 500 company and have requested a feature but have not sponsored the repo maintainer.
How to Use
To use the Burden Bot, you must first add it to your open source Github repository. Once added, the bot will start monitoring the repository's issues and pull requests.

## Configuration
To enable the advanced features of the Burden Bot, you need to configure it with the necessary access tokens and API keys. This configuration can be done via environment variables or a configuration file.

The following are the environment variables that need to be set:

GITHUB_TOKEN: This token is required to access Github's API.
THANKS_DEV_TOKEN: This token is required to access Thanks.dev's API.

## Usage
When the Burden Bot identifies an issue that is beyond the scope of the license, it will leave a message for the requestor. The message will include the following information:

"This issue seems to be beyond the scope of [license], given that this is a [issue type] raised by [employee] [company] whoâ€™s currently not [funding] / [MAINTAINER].

Please consider supporting the [project] & [ecosystem] by funding your dependency tree."

The Burden Bot will continue to monitor the repository's issues and pull requests and perform the necessary actions based on the configured rules.
